# IFR-Notepad
For those who are experienced IFR pilots or students learning the scripts and phraseology, I put together a PDF document that I print two pages per sheet, folder it in half, and put on my kneepad or you can send it to documents in ForeFlight and annotate directly on it with your iPad.    I was inspired by many checklists and my own training and thought I'd share.  It may not be perfect, but it will probably evolve over time or as I get more experienced may ditch it completely.
